Description:
This full stack web gis application implements the Django framework to render a responsive earthquake forecasting map. Potential earthquakes are predicted using Python to create an automated machine learning engine that is embedded within the application. All of the data, including the model generated by the machine learning pipeline, is saved within a PostgreSQL database. When the app requires some data from PostgreSQL, REST API endpoints are created and quickly called upon using JQuery and Ajax. The data that is pulled from the backend is then passed to HTML5, CSS, and Leaflet.js code to display the basemap, feature layers, and GUI to the user. Extra features the gis app contains include: title, legend, prediction score percentage, changeable basemaps, toggleable layers, and collapsable sidebar.

To launch this application:
1. cd to project root directory (quake)
2. run command to start virtual environment venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
3. start up pgAdmin and connect to PostrgreSQL database
4. run command to launch Django localhost server
    python .\manage.py runserver
5. open browser and navigate to localhost:8000 to view web app!

To terminate session:
1. turn off localhost server
    Ctrl + C
2. run command to terminate virtual environment venv
    deactivate
3. close browser windows displaying pgAdmin & localhost:8000
